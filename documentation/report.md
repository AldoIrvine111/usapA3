# Graph

The graph above is showing the CPU temperature of the Raspberry Pi while compiling the kernel. The average temperature before compiling the kernel is 60-65 Degree Celcius. The graph above shows that while compiling the kernel, it reach around 85-90 Degree Celcius. 
The case I had is does not have a good ventilation, so I had to take off the cover of the Case and plug a fan directly infront of the Pi to cool it off. The graph show that the cooling help alots in decreasing the temperature. 
The time to compile the kernel vary, it depends on the specs of Pi you have. This process takes time because of installing features, modules, and drives. User can customized these features. In this compilation, we omit camera and video support as per the requirement.
